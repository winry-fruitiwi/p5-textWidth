 * coding plan üîß
 * ‚òí display black background, white text.
 * ‚òí write 'i' and 'm' on screen to compare their widths
 *     ‚òí check your chrome zoom settings. accurate results only at 100%
 * ‚òê measure each character's width by checking pixels in order
 *     ‚òê loadpixels in small canvas: 30x50 or so
 *     ‚òê iterate through every canvas pixel from left to right
 *     ‚òê keep track of the last non-black pixel you saw. that's the width!
 *         ‚òê how do you determine "non-black"? there are 4 values per pixel
 * ‚òê encapsulate functions
 *     ‚òê one using .get to retrieve color 'object'
 *          ‚òê see .get() docs https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/get
 *     ‚òê the other using pixels[]
 * ‚òê convert to pGraphics object: off-screen buffer with createGraphics
 * ‚òê use charWidth to display single words
 * ‚òê now use charWidth to make textWidth. exception for gigamaru space char
 * ‚òê transfer into p5-dialogsystem!

        My log for this program:
            Cody and I both did not iterate when we were doing our
            textWidth project today. The best outcome was that I started by
            iterating with a very simple example on my drawing pad: a 3 by
            3 grid with randomly turned on pixel "characters". This was
            supposed to be a 15-minute project, but it took 60 minutes
            instead. After we completed our basic example, we could iterate
            from there, tracing my code with 4x4 and uneven graphics.
